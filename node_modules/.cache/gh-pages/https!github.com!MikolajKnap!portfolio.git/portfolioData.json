I would like to learn more about maldev in the future. It is helpful because it gives me perspective on how malware tries to evade detection and also this topic is interesting to me so I really enjoy learning about it.",

I have used David Bombal youtube series dedicated to analizing network traffic using Wireshark in which He uploads pcap files to analize traffic yourself. After the project I have learned practical skills of how to analize network traffic and why security is key in modern networks.",
